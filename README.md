# Substrate-Project-Management-Tutorial

## Introduction
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate a sample of work for a project that will be used as a reference for tracking development work. This to reduce the overall friction of performing code reviews over the lifetime of a project's development and administration such as dynamic changes to the planned deliverables to remain agile for development.

## Leveraging Projects
The objective for clarity in the presentation of project is to leverage Github's Project feature:
